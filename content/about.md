# About me

Hi, I am Krzysztof Hrynczenko and I am a programmer.
Throughout the years I have and I am still gathering a lot of knowledge. I made
this blog is a place where I can store it and share it with others.
I started programming in high school with Pascal and C and initially, I did not
like it at all. After some time something clicked and I got passionate about it.
I try to explore anything that I find interesting. Nowadays, it is compilers,
deep learning, and functional programming. Tomorrow, it may be games or
cryptography, who knows. When it comes to languages I feel quite comfortable
with C++ and Python and I try to get into Rust and Haskell. Rust because I just
find it so robust and practical, and Haskell just because it feels cool.

You can find more about me on my LinkedIn and GitHub pages.
